# Change Log
This change log was started in August 2014. All notable changes to this project
henceforth should be documented here.

## Version 1.4.0 - 2014-09-23
### Added

*   Add support for Rails 4.2.0! Let us know if you encounter any issues.

    *Xiang Li*

*   Add `not_true` and `not_false` predicates and update the "Basic Searching"
    wiki. Fixes #123, #353.

    *Pedro Chambino*

*   Add `ro.yml` Romanian translation file.

    *Andreas Philippi*

*   Add new documentation in the README explaining how to group queries by `OR`
    instead of the default `AND` using the `m: 'or'` combinator.

*   Add new documentation in the README and in the source code comments
    explaining in detail how to handle whitelisting/authorization of
    attributes, associations, sorts and scopes.

*   Add new documentation in the README explaining in more detail how to use
    scopes for searching with Ransack.

*   Begin a CHANGELOG.

    *Jon Atack*

### Fixed

*   Fix singular/plural Active Record attribute translations.

    *Andreas Philippi*

*   Fix the params hash being modified by `Search.new` and the Ransack scope.

    *Daniel Rikowski*

*   Apply default scope conditions for association joins (fix for Rails 3).

    Avoid selecting records from joins that would normally be filtered out
    if they were selected from the base table. Only applies to Rails 3, as
    this issue was fixed in Rails 4.

    *Andrew Vit*

*   Fix incoherent code examples in the README Associations section that
    sometimes used `@q` and other times `@search`.

    *Jon Atack*

### Changed

*   Refactor Ransack::Translate.

*   Rewrite much of the Ransack README documentation, including the
    Associations section code examples and the Authorizations section detailing
    how to whitelist attributes, associations, sorts and scopes.

## Version 1.3.0 - 2014-08-23
### Added

*   Add search scopes by popular demand. Using `ransackable_scopes`, users can
    define whitelists for allowed model scopes on a parent table. Not yet
    implemented for associated models' scopes; scopes must be defined on the
    parent table.

    *Gleb Mazovetskiy*, *Andrew Vit*, *Sven Schwyn*

*   Add `JOINS` merging.

*   Add `OR` grouping on base search.

*   Allow authorizing/whitelisting attributes, associations, sorts and scopes.

*   Improve boolean predicatesâ€™ handling of `false` values.

*   Allow configuring Ransack to raise on instead of ignore unknown search
    conditions.

*   Allow passing blank values to search without crashing.

*   Add wildcard escaping compatibility for SQL Server databases.

*   Add various I18n translations.
